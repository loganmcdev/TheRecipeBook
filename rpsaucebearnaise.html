        <ol type="i">
            <li>To clarify the butter, melt it in a saucepan over medium heat, checking from time to time to prevent the butter from burning. Remove from the heat and skim off any froth that has floated to the surface. Pour off the remaining butterfat into a separate container, leaving the proteins settled at the bottom.</li>
            <li>To prepare the reduction, peel and chop the shallots. Strip the tarragon leaves from the stems, rough chop and set aside for the end. Crack the peppercorns using a mortar and pestle and set aside. In a small saucepan, combine the vinegar, white wine, herb stems, shallots, and the cracked peppercorns.</li>
            <li> Heat over medium flame until the mixture comes to a simmer. Continue reducing for 15-20 minutes or until the mixture has reduced by two-thirds. Once reduced, strain the mixture into a new container.</li>
            <li>Combine the egg yolk(s) with cold water in a small saucepan and whisk for 30 seconds or until light and frothy. Heat the saucepan over medium-high heat, whisking rapidly. The mixture will increase in volume and begin to thicken. Continue whisking rapidly for 5 seconds to ensure it is fully cooked. Remove the sauce pan from the heat and whisk for 20 seconds to cool.</li>
            <li>Ladle the clarified butter into the sauce pan while slowly stirring with the whisk. The sauce will begin to have a stiff texture. Add the tarragon reduction until the sauce has the right texture and desired flavor. Add the chopped tarragon to the sauce and stir to combine.</li>
            <li> Adjust the sauces flavors, it may need salt, white pepper or additional vinegar. If too acidic, lengthen with more fat or liquid. Set aside the finished sauce and hold warm until serving. </li>
