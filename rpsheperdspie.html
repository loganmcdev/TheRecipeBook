    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Wash the red potatoes and cut into quarters before adding them into a pot of water and bringing it to a boil.</li>
        <li>In a separate sauce pan add together the minced garlic, heavy cream, salt (as well as any additional herbs and spices) and heat to a simmer.</li>
        <li>To test the doneness of the potatoes, poke them with a fork. If they are soft enough to mash, and they easily remove from the fork, they are ready to strain. This should take 25-40 minutes. </li>
        <li>Strain the softened potatoes and return them to the pot. Add the heavy cream from the saucepan and use a masher to combine. The potatoes should be soft enough that this could also be done with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Continue mixing until smooth and no large pieces remain. Once the cream is well combined, cube and add the cold butter to the pot.</li>
        <li>Whisk the potatoes thoroughly until all the butter is melted. It's important to whisk the butter in completely to prevent separation. </li>
        <li>Set the mashed potatoes aside and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Next, brown the hamburg in a large skillet and set the oven to preheat at 375 F . </li>
        <li>Once browned, strain the hamburg and add it to a cassarole pan. </li>
        <li>Evenly cover the hamburg with corn and gravy. </li>
        <li>Afterwards, add the mashed potatoes. The mashed should reach all the way to the edges of the pan and have an even thickness all the way around. This helps to prevent the gravy from bubbling over the top. (you can add cheese if you would like)</li>
        <li>Bake at 375 F for 20-35 minutes or until a light crust has formed.</li>
        <li>Allow the pie to cool for at least 15 minututes before serving (and it always taste better leftover!)</li>
